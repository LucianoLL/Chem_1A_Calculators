Develop: 05/11/2022 - 05/26/2022

Summary:
Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calcualtions associated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in clacualtions and quickly look up elements.
The calcualtors associated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

UPDATES:
5/26/2022 - We have the Molar Mass calculator ready for testing, please leave comments in you run to any issues.

Note:
For instructions on how to download and run the programs, please refer to the wiki on this page.
