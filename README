Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calcualtions assiciated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in clacualtions and quickly look up elements.
The calcualtors assiociated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

Started working on the dictionary for the periodic table to allow for accessible reach of elements
and their data.
