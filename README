For instructions on how to download and run the programs, please refer to the wiki on this page.

Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calculations associated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in calculations and quickly look up elements.
The calculators associated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

UPDATES:
07/17/2022 - I have now made insturctions in this pages wiki to run the calculators outside of the 
UCSC timeshare in case students of other establishments want to utilize them. Keep in mind that the 
calculators might not work at a 100% since they're meant to run on the UCSC timeshare, but it 
shouldn't be too much of an issue.
