Chem 1A Calculators
Luciano Loma Lorenzana
Develop: 05/11/2022 - 05/20/2022

Summary:
Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calcualtions assiciated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in clacualtions and quickly look up elements.
The calcualtors assiociated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

Instructions:
To run QuadraticFormula.cpp
Type:
"cd .\relevent_formula_calculators\"
"g++ QuadraticFormula.cpp"
".\a.exe"

Development Notes:
05/20/2022
Started to work on the makefile to allow for the user to easily compile the entire program.
I'm still inexpereienced when writing makefiles, but I'm sure I can up with something, we'll see.

05/15/2022
Worked on a program that could be useful for when the quadratic formula is necessary for certain
calculations. Designed to currently run on the terminal, and it's really basic. All inputs have to
be numerical, input cannot have any symbols besides for "-". Will work on later on to accept other case
as fractions and scientific notation.

05/11/2022
Started working on the dictionary for the periodic table to allow for accessible reach of elements
and their data.
