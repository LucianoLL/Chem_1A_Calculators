Summary:
Calcualtors that are meant to help in the micro calcualtions assiciated with chemistry, along with
a dictionary of the periodic table to ease in clacualtions and quickly look up elements.
The calcualtors assiociated will deal with calculating molar mass, determining limiting reactants,
and perhaps some stoichiometry and equilibriums.

Note:
For instructions on how to download and run the programs, please refer to the wiki on this page.
